# ANN and CNN comparison
It is an exploratory project to understand the advantages of convolution based network over plain vanilla network for image classification problems.
I have used MNIST dataset for this comparison. 

Results
- CNN converges faster than plain vanilla network
- With equal number of epochs, CNN gave 2% more validation accuracy as compared to vanilla network
