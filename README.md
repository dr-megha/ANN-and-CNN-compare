# ANN and CNN comparison
This work is intended to understand the power of Convolutions for extracting abstract features from images. I have used MNIST dataset for this comparison. 

Notes
- CNN converges faster then plain vanilla network
- With equal number of epochs, CNN gave 0.2% more validation accuracy as compared to vanilla network
